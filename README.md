# Preferred Linter Rules

This repository lists all the Linter rules that I choose to use in my Flutter projects. 
Specified rules are defined in the <ins>analysis_options.yaml</ins> file.

I did not include the rules that already come with flutter_lints: ^2.0.0.

More information can be obtained on the [Linter Rules](https://dart.dev/tools/linter-rules) site.
